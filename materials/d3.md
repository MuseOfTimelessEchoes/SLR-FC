# AI Tools for Optimal Journal Matching

AI tools for optimal journal matching are designed to assist researchers in finding the most suitable journals for their manuscripts. These tools use advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques to analyze the content of a paper, such as the title, abstract, and keywords, and then match it with journals that have published similar articles.
