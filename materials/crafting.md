# 7 Steps for Crafting a Powerful Literature Review 💪🏻
Articles that use PRISMA have a much higher acceptance chance. 
[ Scroll down for tips on Boolean operators ]

1. 𝘋𝘦𝘧𝘪𝘯𝘦 𝘢 𝘊𝘭𝘦𝘢𝘳 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘍𝘰𝘤𝘶𝘴𝘦𝘥 𝘙𝘦𝘴𝘦𝘢𝘳𝘤𝘩 𝘘𝘶𝘦𝘴𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯
Your research question will be the backbone of your systematic review. It should be specific, answerable, and relevant to your field of study.

2. 𝘋𝘦𝘷𝘦𝘭𝘰𝘱 𝘢 𝘊𝘰𝘮𝘱𝘳𝘦𝘩𝘦𝘯𝘴𝘪𝘷𝘦 𝘚𝘦𝘢𝘳𝘤𝘩 𝘚𝘵𝘳𝘢𝘵𝘦𝘨𝘺
Identify relevant databases (e.g., Web of Science, PubMed, Google Scholar) and create a list of keywords and search terms that encompass your research question. Consider using Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT) to refine your search.

3. 𝘌𝘴𝘵𝘢𝘣𝘭𝘪𝘴𝘩 𝘐𝘯𝘤𝘭𝘶𝘴𝘪𝘰𝘯 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘌𝘹𝘤𝘭𝘶𝘴𝘪𝘰𝘯 𝘊𝘳𝘪𝘵𝘦𝘳𝘪𝘢
Determine the types of studies (e.g., randomized controlled trials, observational studies, qualitative research) and the specific criteria (e.g., publication date range, language, sample type, or size) that will be included or excluded from your review.

4. 𝘚𝘤𝘳𝘦𝘦𝘯 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘚𝘦𝘭𝘦𝘤𝘵 𝘚𝘵𝘶𝘥𝘪𝘦𝘴 𝘚𝘺𝘴𝘵𝘦𝘮𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘤𝘢𝘭𝘭𝘺
Apply your inclusion and exclusion criteria to the titles and abstracts of the identified studies. Remember that full-text availability and conclusiveness of the study are considered inclusion criteria as well. 

5. 𝘌𝘹𝘵𝘳𝘢𝘤𝘵 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘖𝘳𝘨𝘢𝘯𝘪𝘻𝘦 𝘋𝘢𝘵𝘢
Develop a standardized data extraction form to collect relevant information from each included study. This may include study characteristics (e.g., sample size, study design), results, and methodological quality.

6. 𝘚𝘺𝘯𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘴𝘪𝘻𝘦 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘈𝘯𝘢𝘭𝘺𝘻𝘦 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘍𝘪𝘯𝘥𝘪𝘯𝘨𝘴
Summarize the main findings of the included studies in a clear and concise manner. Use 𝐭𝐚𝐛𝐥𝐞𝐬 and 𝐟𝐢𝐠𝐮𝐫𝐞𝐬 to present data effectively. If appropriate, conduct a meta-analysis to combine the results of multiple studies statistically.

7. 𝘐𝘯𝘵𝘦𝘳𝘱𝘳𝘦𝘵 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘍𝘪𝘯𝘥𝘪𝘯𝘨𝘴 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘋𝘳𝘢𝘸 𝘊𝘰𝘯𝘤𝘭𝘶𝘴𝘪𝘰𝘯𝘴
Discuss the implications of your findings in the context of existing research and theory. Identify knowledge gaps and suggest areas for future research. Highlight the strengths and limitations of your systematic review.

PRO TIP ON BOOLEAN OPERATORS 👇🏻

↳ Use "AND" when you want to find results that include all the terms you specify. This narrows your search.
↳ Use "OR" when you want to find results that include at least one of the terms you specify. This broadens your search.
↳ Use "NOT" when you want to exclude results that contain a specific term. This refines your search.
