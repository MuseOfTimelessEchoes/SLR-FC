### 3. Pandoc Plugin

The [Pandoc Plugin](https://github.com/OliverBalfour/obsidian-pandoc) allows users to export their notes to a variety of formats using Pandoc, a command-line tool for document conversion. Supported export formats include Word, PDF, ePub, HTML, PowerPoint, LaTeX, and more. Users can also use Pandoc templates and citations to customize the output according to their preferences.

This lets you **write presentations, draft books, make webpages**, and **write assignments** all in Markdown, and export to whichever format you fancy, all without leaving Obsidian.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/OliverBalfour/obsidian-pandoc/raw/master/command-palette.png"  height="300" /> <br>

</p>

#### Basic usage
- Press `Ctrl+P/Cmd+P` to show the command palette
- Search `Pandoc`
- Choose your export format
- If all goes well, it will say it was successful
- If you exported a file called `Pandoc.md` as a Word Document, in your file explorer there will be a `Pandoc.docx` file in the same folder

#### Troubleshooting

A common issue is that the settings page will display the red error message `Pandoc is not installed or accessible on your PATH. This plugin's functionality will be limited.`

If you encounter this issue:
**[Installing pandoc](https://pandoc.org/installing.html)**

1. Open the plugin settings and scroll to the bottom
2. There is a setting called `Pandoc path`. Set this setting to:
   - Mac/Linux: the output of `which pandoc` in a terminal
   - Windows: the output of `Get-Command pandoc` in PowerShell

After fixing it, relaunch Obsidian and it should  work!

### 4. Pandoc Reference List Plugin

<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-pandoc-reference-list/main/Screen%20Shot.png"  height="300" /> <br>
</p>

The [Pandoc Reference List plugin](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-pandoc-reference-list) provides a formatted reference in the sidebar for each Pandoc citekey present in the current document. It utilizes Pandoc to generate the reference style, and users can choose from thousands of CSL styles. To use this plugin, users need to supply a compatible bibliography file, such as a .bib or .json file, which contains the references.

#### Set up instructions

- Ensure [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) is installed. **This plugin requires at least version 2.11**.
- Supply a path to a compatible bibliography file
- (Optional) Supply a path or URL to a compatible [CSL style](https://citationstyles.org/)

These plugins can help you make your notes more organized, informative, and creative. You can install them from the Obsidian community plugins page or from their GitHub repositories.

### Updates for your plugins
